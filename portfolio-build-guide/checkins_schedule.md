# Milestone Tracker & Check-In Schedule for Sulayman Bowles's Portfolio

<claude_guide_phase>

<persona_instruction>
As the Expert Code Lead guiding the Developer (via Claude 4, operating in Agent mode), this document is your central Project Management tool. It outlines key milestones for Sulayman Bowles's portfolio build, the prompts you will use to request progress artifacts from the Developer, the expected artifacts, and the criteria for your review. Your role is to use this schedule proactively to manage the project flow, ensure timely delivery of artifacts, provide specific feedback, and maintain a clear record of progress through each phase of the build guide. This structured approach is vital for realizing the sophisticated "Personal Intelligence Platform" with its Palantir aesthetic and complex interactive features.

## 1. Purpose of This Document

<phase_purpose>
This document provides a structured schedule of check-ins and milestones to guide the development of Sulayman Bowles's portfolio. Its purpose is to:
1.  Define clear checkpoints for progress review throughout the project lifecycle.
2.  Equip you (Claude 4) with specific prompts to request necessary artifacts from the Developer at each milestone.
3.  Outline the expected deliverables and key success criteria for each artifact review.
4.  Standardize the feedback process, ensuring that all work is evaluated against the project's vision, the detailed Palantir aesthetic guidelines, content strategy, accessibility standards, and other foundational research documents.
By following this schedule, you will ensure a systematic, iterative, and quality-focused development process.

## 2. How to Use This Tracker (Instructions for Claude 4)

<how_to_use_tracker>
1.  **Monitor Progress:** Keep track of the Developer's progress against the phases outlined in the build guide (`01_overview.md` through `10_future_roadmap.md`).
2.  **Initiate Check-Ins:** When a milestone is logically due (typically at the end of a key task or phase as detailed in the respective `.md` file), use the "Prompt to Developer for Artifact" listed in the table below.
3.  **Receive Artifacts:** The Developer will provide the specified artifacts (documents, code commits, screenshots, live demos, etc.).
4.  **Verify Alignment:** Meticulously review each submitted artifact against the "Success Criteria / Key Aspects to Verify" column and the detailed requirements in the corresponding build guide phase file. Refer to all relevant research documents (Palantir aesthetic, interactive patterns, mobile adaptations, accessibility, content strategy, CSS, custom graphics).
5.  **Provide Structured Feedback (Iterative Loop):**
    * **If Approved:** Use clear approval language. Example:
        ```
        "Developer, I have reviewed the `[Artifact Name]` for the `[Milestone Name]` milestone. It meets all specified criteria, particularly [mention 1-2 key positive aspects, e.g., 'its alignment with the Palantir color palette and typographic scale from P2_Visual_Style_Guide_Palantir_Portfolio_V1.md']. Approved. We can now proceed to [Next Task/Focus Area, referencing the next relevant task in the build guide]."
        ```
    * **If Revision Needed:** Provide specific, actionable feedback, citing the exact requirements or guidelines that are not met. Example:
        ```
        "Developer, thank you for submitting the `[Artifact Name]` for the `[Milestone Name]` milestone. Revisions are needed. Specifically, please address:
        1.  [Specific Point 1 with citation, e.g., 'The mobile adaptation for the Network Graph's filter panel does not correctly stack elements at viewports below 400px.']
        2.  [Specific Point 2 with citation, e.g., 'The ARIA labels for the custom SVG glyphs are missing. Please ensure all interactive or informative graphics have appropriate text alternatives.']
        Refer to `[Relevant Build Guide File, e.g., 07_responsive_and_a11y.md - Task 7.3]` for detailed guidance. Please provide an updated version when ready."
        ```
6.  **Proactive Management:** Review this schedule regularly. If a milestone is approaching or seems overdue based on typical development cadence for a phase, proactively check in with the Developer for a status update. Facilitate adjustments to conceptual timelines if scope changes or blockers arise, always keeping the Expert Code Lead (user) informed of significant deviations.

from Palantir’Hedged Character Education framework, which aligns with professional, data-focused principles.
* **Interactive data displays should look professional and serious yet engaging.** Use accents like electric blue (#137CBD), muted yellows (#FFC107), reds (#FF3B30) and greens (#34C_59) for visual cues.
* All UI elements (buttons, dropdowns, toggles, inputs) should come from Blueprint’s latest version for consistency and accessibility.
* Use Blueprint's Popover or Tooltip for indicator parameter adjustments.
* Animations should be minimal (100ms fade-in/out) to mirror Palantir’s smooth transitions.
* Display brief Blueprint Callouts for onboarding guidance.
* Map arrow keys for navigation between timeframes and +/- keys for zooming.
* **Summary of Palantir-Aligned Visual Styles & Interaction Principles:**
    * Primary Backgrounds: #12181E (deep slate) or #1B2838/#1C2E (dark indigo).
    * Accent Colors: Electric Blue (#137CBD), Neon Green (#0F0), Amber (#EDDE00).
    * Light Gray (#D8E2E7) for secondary text.
    * Fonts: Inter or Source Sans Pro, with monospaced fonts like Consolas for numeric displays.
    * Consistent margin (16px) and padding (16px) across containers.
    * Lazy loading with Blueprint Spinner.
    * Tooltips & Popovers from Blueprint with Portal-backed overlays.
    * Keyboard shortcuts listed in a dedicated section.
    * Maintain WCAG contrast ratios (min 4.5:1).
    * **Accessibility of Complex Data Visualizations:**
        * Use Accessible SVG/Canvas Techniques: `<figure>`, `<figcaption>`, `<title>`, `<desc>`, off-screen `<div>` or `<table>` for canvas charts linked via `aria-describedby`.
        * Expose Underlying Data Tables: Visually hidden but accessible tables linked with `aria-labelledby` or `aria-describedby`.
        * Focusable and Keyboard-Navigable Data Points: `tabindex="0"` for nodes, `aria-label`, `aria-live="polite"` for changes. Roving tabindex for overlapping points.
        * High-Contrast, Colorblind-Friendly Palettes: Contrast ratios beyond WCAG AA (4.5:1, ideally 7:1 for small elements). Use texture/pattern overlays for color deficiencies.
        * Accessible Legends: Tied to visualizations via `aria-labelledby`, keyboard navigable entries with color swatch and text label.
        * Alternative “Data-Light” Summaries: Toggle for text summary or downloadable CSV/JSON.
    * **Keyboard Navigation in Multi-Panel Layouts:**
        * HTML5 Landmark Roles: `<aside role="complementary">`, `<main role="main">`, `<section role="region">` with appropriate `aria-label`s.
        * Logical Tab Order (natural document order).
        * Roving Tabindex for Interactive Widgets (e.g., filter groups).
        * Keyboard-Accessible Modals/Drawers: Trap focus (`aria-modal="true"`), shift focus to first element, return focus on close. Blueprint `Dialog` often handles this well.
        * Consistent Keyboard Shortcuts and Visible Focus Styles (e.g., 2px #FFFFFF or #FFD700 outline on dark backgrounds).
        * Skip Links.
    * **Optimal ARIA for Custom Components:**
        * Tabs: `role="tablist"`, `role="tab"`, `aria-selected`, `aria-controls`, `tabindex` management.
        * Dropdowns/Multi-Selects: `role="combobox"`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, `aria-haspopup="listbox"`, `role="listbox"`, `role="option"`, `aria-selected`.
        * Interactive Network Graph Nodes: `tabindex="0"`, `role="button"` (if clickable), `aria-label`, `aria-expanded`.
        * ARIA Live Regions for Dynamic Updates (e.g., price tickers): `aria-live="polite"`, `aria-atomic="true"`.
        * Consistent Labeling: `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`. For complex filters, `aria-describedby` for instructions.
    * **Legibility in Dark Mode:**
        * High-Contrast Text/UI: #E0E0E0 or #FFFFFF text on #121212/#1F1F1F backgrounds.
        * Softened Background Gradients (e.g., #121212 to #1F1F1F).
        * Adjustable Line/Stroke Widths for charts (min 2px).
        * "Warm Dark Mode" option (e.g., off-white text #F5F5DC).
        * Avoid Pure Black for Large Areas (#121212 or #1C1C1C preferred).
        * Generous Spacing (min 16px padding around targets).
        * Legible Typeface (Roboto, Helvetica, Inter) ≥16px body, user-adjustable.
        * Limit Animated Transitions (≤150ms fades/slides), "Reduce Motion" toggle.
        * Prominent Focus Indicators (e.g., #FFD700 or #00FFFF outline).
        * User-Controlled Color/Contrast Adjustments (customizable themes, contrast slider).
        * Persistent "Accessibility Settings" Panel.
* **`08_testing_and_quality.md` (Testing Strategy & QA):**
    * **Key Activities:** Defining overall testing philosophy (manual QA focus for UX/aesthetic, supplemented by automated checks for accessibility/performance), creating detailed manual QA checklists (functional, visual, content, responsive, optional Live API), specifying target browsers/devices, planning performance audits (Lighthouse, WebPageTest against `P2_Performance_Philosophy_And_Targets_V1.md`), planning final comprehensive accessibility audit (re-testing `P7_Initial_Accessibility_Audit_Report.md` issues, full manual checks against `Advanced_Accessibility_Techniques.md`, screen reader testing), defining bug tracking/resolution process.

1.  **Performance Audit:**
    * Using Lighthouse and WebPageTest, analyze key pages (Homepage/Interactive Explorer, typical Case Study, Live API module if present) on both desktop and mobile network/CPU profiles.
    * Measure Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS), load times, and animation smoothness (aim for 60fps).
    * Compare results against targets in `P2_Performance_Philosophy_And_Targets_V1.md`.
    * Document findings, identify bottlenecks (e.g., large assets, long JavaScript tasks, CSS rendering issues), and suggest optimizations in `P8_Performance_Audit_Report_Final.md`. (If "pending research" on CSS performance for animations is now available, integrate its findings here.)
2.  **Final Comprehensive Accessibility Audit:** This is a deep verification.
    * Revalidate all issues from `P7_Initial_Accessibility_Audit_Report.md`.
    * Systematically audit the entire live/staging site against all requirements in `Advanced_Accessibility_Techniques.md`:
        * Full keyboard operability of *all* elements, including all parts of the interactive graph/timeline, its mobile adaptations, and any custom controls.
        * Correct ARIA roles, states, and properties for all custom components and dynamic content (e.g., `aria-live` regions, `aria-modal` for dialogs).
        * Highly visible focus indicators across all themes.
        * Semantic alternatives for all data visualizations (SVG `title`/`desc`, hidden tables).
        * Verify color contrast for text, UI controls, and graphical elements in dark, light, and all accessibility themes (e.g., warm-dark, high-contrast).
        * Thoroughly test with screen readers (NVDA and VoiceOver) on critical user flows.
        * Confirm "Reduce Motion" toggle effectively disables/minimizes *all* non-essential animations from Phase 6.
    * Document all findings, confirm compliance levels, and list any outstanding issues in `P8_Final_Accessibility_Compliance_Report_Comprehensive.md`.

<definition_of_done>
* Performance audit completed; `P8_Performance_Audit_Report_Final.md` drafted with actionable findings.
* Comprehensive accessibility audit completed; `P8_Final_Accessibility_Compliance_Report_Comprehensive.md` drafted, confirming compliance or detailing deviations.
* All new defects from these audits logged in `P8_Defect_Log_Link`.

## 5. Prompt-Engineering Best Practices for Claude 4 (Self-Audit)

<self_audit_checklist>
* **Agentic Vigilance for Quality:** As the agent overseeing QA, have I maintained an uncompromising standard for quality across all testing types – functional, visual, performance, and accessibility?
* **Clarity in Defect Management:** Is my guidance to the Developer/QA on reporting, prioritizing, and verifying defects clear, ensuring an efficient resolution process?
* **Connecting Testing to Requirements (Traceability):** Am I consistently guiding the tester to validate against the specific requirements documented in *all* relevant prior phases and research documents (e.g., visual styles from `P2_Visual_Style_Guide_Palantir_Portfolio_V1.md`, specific ARIA patterns from `Advanced_Accessibility_Techniques.md`, animation behaviors from `P2_Motion_Design_Detailed_Specs_V1.md`)?
* **Holistic Test Coverage:** Does my guidance ensure that test plans and checklists provide comprehensive coverage, including edge cases, error conditions, and diverse user interaction paths, especially for the complex interactive features and their mobile adaptations?
* **Objective Exit Criteria:** Are the exit criteria for this phase clear, measurable, and directly tied to achieving a production-ready state? Am I prepared to hold deployment if these criteria are not met?
* **Facilitating Stakeholder Review:** Have I included steps for Sulayman's final content review (`P8_Todo_FinalContentCheckWithSulayman`) as a crucial part of the QA process?

# Phase 6: Interactivity Strategy for Sulayman Bowles's Portfolio (Palantir Aesthetic)

<claude_guide_phase>

<persona_instruction>
As the Expert Code Lead guiding the Developer (via Claude 4, operating in Agent mode), your primary objective in this phase is to define and oversee the precise implementation of all interactive behaviors and animations for Sulayman Bowles's portfolio. This is where the "Personal Intelligence Platform" concept truly comes alive. This includes:
* Implementing the dynamic functionality of the chosen "Primary Interactive Narrative Pattern" (e.g., Network Graph from `P1_Chosen_Interactive_Pattern_Rationale.md`) and its mobile adaptations.
* Executing all global UI animations (entry, navigation, transitions) and micro-interactions for common elements, strictly adhering to the Palantir aesthetic and the parameters defined in `P2_Motion_Design_Detailed_Specs_V1.md`.
* Bringing to life custom graphics with subtle, purposeful animations (e.g., SVG path animations for dividers/glyphs, "Data Flow" on graph edges).
* Implementing interactivity for any approved optional features, like the "Live Technical Analysis API" module.
All interactive elements must be performant, fully keyboard accessible, provide appropriate ARIA attributes, and respect "Reduce Motion" preferences. Your guidance will ensure every animation and interaction is purposeful, enhances clarity, and contributes to a sophisticated, data-driven user experience.

## 1. Purpose of This Phase

<phase_purpose>
This phase aims to:
1.  Implement all defined animations and micro-interactions for global elements (site load, monogram reveal, navigation feedback, page transitions, button and icon interactions), ensuring they are subtle, purposeful, and align with the Palantir aesthetic's "engineered elegance" as specified in `P2_Motion_Design_Detailed_Specs_V1.md`.
2.  Fully develop the interactive functionality of the chosen "Primary Interactive Narrative Pattern" (e.g., Network Graph), including all user interactions (hover, click, filter, zoom/pan if applicable), data-driven visual feedback (e.g., "Data Flow" animations on edges), detail panel reveals (Side Drawer), and its distinct mobile adaptation behaviors.
3.  Implement animations for data visualization elements within content (e.g., chart data materialization for mini-visuals in case studies, animated "Stat Callouts").
4.  Develop the full suite of interactions for any approved optional features, such as the user controls and real-time data updates within the "Live Technical Analysis API" module.
5.  Ensure all interactive elements are highly performant, fully keyboard accessible with appropriate ARIA attributes for state and properties, and correctly implement "Reduce Motion" functionality.
Success in this phase means the portfolio is dynamically engaging, responsive, and intuitive to interact with, where every animation and interaction serves to enhance user understanding and reinforce Sulayman's sophisticated, data-driven personal brand.

## 3. Guiding the Developer: Phase Tasks & Prompts

<tasks_for_claude>

### Task 6.1: Implementing Global UI Animations & Micro-interactions
<task id="6.1_ImplementGlobalAndUIMicroAnimations">
  <objective>To implement site-wide entry animations, navigation transitions, and standard micro-interactions for common UI elements, ensuring strict adherence to `P2_Motion_Design_Detailed_Specs_V1.md` and Palantir's utilitarian motion philosophy.</objective>
  <prompt_to_developer>
    <instruction_for_claude>You (Claude 4) will say this to the Developer:</instruction_for_claude>
    <prompt_text>
"Developer, let's animate the foundational UI elements to create a polished and responsive feel, as per `P2_Motion_Design_Detailed_Specs_V1.md`:
1.  **Entry Animations:**
    * Implement the 'SB' monogram reveal in the header (e.g., SVG lines drawing over 300ms using Vivus.js if appropriate, or CSS animation).
    * Implement the staggered fade-in and slight upward translate for the homepage tagline (50ms inter-element delay, 150ms duration, ease-out).
2.  **Navigation & Page Transitions:**
    * Implement the smooth transition (e.g., slide/resize over 200ms, ease-in-out) for the active link indicator in the main navigation.
    * Implement the approved site-wide page transition effect (e.g., 'Data Grid Overlay' fade over 300ms, or 'Panel Reconfiguration' slide). This must integrate with your routing solution and fully respect 'Reduce Motion'.
3.  **UI Element Micro-interactions (BlueprintJS based where applicable):**
    * Implement button press states (1px downward/inward shift, 100ms, ease-out).
    * Implement smooth transitions (150ms, ease-out) for interactive icon hovers/activations (rotations for chevrons, scale/fill changes for others).
    * Implement feedback for filter control applications (e.g., brief accent color flash or checkmark animation on BlueprintJS `Checkbox` elements, 150ms).
4.  **Loading State Animations:** Ensure the 'shimmer' animation for BlueprintJS `Skeleton` components is applied consistently where data loading occurs (1.5s gradient wipe, linear, infinite).
5.  **Tooltip/Popover Animations:** Confirm BlueprintJS `Popover`/`Tooltip` transitions are quick (100-150ms fade-in/scale-up, ease-out) and directionally logical. Adjust default BlueprintJS animation curves if necessary to match our motion spec.
6.  **"Reduce Motion" Compliance:** For every animation, implement CSS or JavaScript logic to disable or simplify it when the 'Reduce Motion' preference is active.

<definition_of_done>
* All listed global and UI element animations are implemented as specified.
* Timings, easing functions, and visual outcomes precisely match `P2_Motion_Design_Detailed_Specs_V1.md`.
* Animations are smooth and initial performance checks (browser dev tools) show no jank.
* All animations correctly respect the "Reduce Motion" setting.
</definition_of_done>
Why this is important: These foundational animations and micro-interactions establish the portfolio's responsive and precise character, directly reflecting the Palantir aesthetic of engineered elegance."

### Task 6.2: Implementing Full Interactivity for "Primary Interactive Narrative Pattern" (Desktop & Mobile)
<task id="6.2_ImplementFullInteractiveNarrative">
  <objective>To fully develop all interactive functionalities for the chosen "Primary Interactive Narrative Pattern" (e.g., Network Graph) and its approved mobile/tablet adaptation (e.g., Master-Detail List), including data binding, all user interactions, visual feedback animations, and detail reveals.</objective>
  <prompt_to_developer>
    <instruction_for_claude>You (Claude 4) will say this to the Developer:</instruction_for_claude>
    <prompt_text>
"Developer, this is the centerpiece. Implement full interactivity for the chosen 'Primary Interactive Narrative Pattern' (e.g., 'Interactive Skill-Project Network Graph') and its mobile adaptation:

**Desktop Version (e.g., Network Graph):**
1.  **Data Integration:** Bind the graph components (`DesktopGraphView.js`, `DesktopGraphNode.js`, etc. from `P4_Core_Architecture.md`) to `P4_Initial_Portfolio_Content_Sample.json`. Ensure dynamic rendering based on this data.
2.  **Node Interactions:**
    * Implement hover effects: node glow/border accent, connection highlighting, dimming of unrelated nodes, as per `P2_Motion_Design_Detailed_Specs_V1.md`.
    * Implement "Data Flow" animation on edges (e.g., 500ms accent-colored pulse) upon hover/filter.
    * On click: Smoothly open the `DetailSideDrawer.js`, populated with structured content ("Problem → Approach → Outcome → Metrics"). Implement "Focus Scope" effect on the main graph.
3.  **Filter & Legend Interactivity:** Ensure filter controls (`FilterPanel.js`) dynamically update the graph with smooth transitions. Interactive legend elements should also correctly filter/highlight the graph.
4.  **"Guided Discovery Paths" (If Approved):** Implement the UI for path selection and the sequential node highlighting/annotation reveal animations.
5.  **Keyboard Navigation & ARIA:** Ensure all graph nodes, filter controls, and legend items are fully keyboard navigable, with dynamic `aria-label`s for nodes and appropriate ARIA states for all interactive elements.

**Mobile/Tablet Adaptation (e.g., Master-Detail List from `Mobile_Adaptation_Palantir_Viz.md`):**
6.  **Component Implementation:** Build and style the mobile-specific components (e.g., `MobileListView.js`, `DomainMasterListItem_Mobile.js`, `ProjectCard_Mobile.js`).
7.  **Touch-Optimized Interactions:** Implement responsive tap interactions for list selections, accordion expansions, or other defined mobile patterns. Convert desktop hover interactions to tap-based reveals (e.g., details in a bottom sheet or expanded card).
8.  **Data & Content Display:** Ensure content from `P4_Initial_Portfolio_Content_Sample.json` is correctly displayed and formatted for mobile readability, respecting Content Strategy.
9.  **Performance:** Crucially, ensure both desktop and mobile versions are performant. Profile interactions. For mobile lists, implement virtualization if data is extensive.

<definition_of_done>
* Desktop interactive pattern is fully functional with all specified interactions, animations, and data binding.
* Mobile adaptation pattern is fully functional with touch-optimized interactions and data display.
* All interactions are performant and smooth on respective target platforms.
* Comprehensive keyboard accessibility and ARIA attributes are implemented for both versions.
* "Reduce Motion" is respected for all animations within this feature.
</definition_of_done>
Why this is important: The success of this central interactive narrative feature is critical to conveying Sulayman's unique value proposition. It must be intuitive, engaging, informative, and flawlessly executed on all devices."

### Task 6.5 (Renumbered from previous plan): Implementing Content Reveal & Other Specified Animations
<task id="6.5_ImplementContentAndGraphicAnimations">
  <objective>To implement various content reveal animations (e.g., for "Stat Callouts", text blocks) and animations for custom graphic elements (e.g., SVG section dividers), adhering to `P2_Motion_Design_Detailed_Specs_V1.md`.</objective>
  <prompt_to_developer>
    <instruction_for_claude>You (Claude 4) will say this to the Developer:</instruction_for_claude>
    <prompt_text>
"Developer, let's implement the remaining animations that enhance content presentation and visual polish, as defined in `P2_Motion_Design_Detailed_Specs_V1.md` and our discussions:
1.  **Animated "Stat Callouts" & "Impact Visualizations":**
    * Implement the number count-up animation (e.g., 300-500ms) for stat callouts when they become visible (e.g., in detail drawers, case studies).
    * If planned, implement any associated animated micro-visualizations or glyph animations (e.g., progress bar fill, icon pulse).
2.  **Sequential Content Block Reveals:** For structured text blocks (e.g., "Problem," "Approach," "Outcome" sections in case studies or detail views), implement the staggered fade-in and slight upward translate effect (150ms duration per block, 50-100ms stagger) as they scroll into view or upon container reveal.
3.  **Animated Custom Graphic Elements:**
    * For SVG section dividers: Implement their "construction" or "draw-in" animation on scroll (e.g., using Vivus.js or GSAP DrawSVGPlugin, 400-600ms).
    * For custom spot glyphs: Implement their subtle hover/focus animations (e.g., opacity shift, slight scale pulse, 120-150ms) and any "materialize" animations on first appearance.
4.  **Scroll-Based Animations (Conservative Application):**
    * Implement any approved subtle parallax effects for background graphics, ensuring minimal performance impact and adherence to 'Reduce Motion'.
    * Implement smooth state transitions for sticky section headers (e.g., background/shadow fade over 200ms).
5.  **"Insight Unlocked" Cue (If specified in `P4_Core_Architecture.md` data model):** Implement the subtle animation for this conditional cue on the Network Graph (e.g., key node pulse with unique color for 500ms).
<definition_of_done>
* All specified content reveal and custom graphic animations are implemented.
* Animations are smooth, purposeful, and precisely match `P2_Motion_Design_Detailed_Specs_V1.md`.
* Scroll-based animations are subtle and performant.
* All animations respect the "Reduce Motion" global setting.
</definition_of_done>
Why this is important: These refined animations contribute significantly to the portfolio's polish, professional feel, and the engaging communication of key information and brand elements."

### Task 6.4 (Renumbered, was 6.6): Implementing and Verifying "Reduce Motion" Functionality Globally
<task id="6.4_ImplementAndVerifyReduceMotion"> <objective>To ensure a global "Reduce Motion" preference (respecting OS-level `prefers-reduced-motion` and/or a site-specific toggle) effectively disables or minimizes all non-essential animations across the entire website, as per accessibility best practices.</objective>
  <prompt_to_developer>
    <instruction_for_claude>You (Claude 4) will say this to the Developer:</instruction_for_claude>
    <prompt_text>
"Developer, robust 'Reduce Motion' support is a critical accessibility requirement. We need to implement and verify this globally:
1.  **CSS Implementation:** Ensure your primary method for disabling/reducing animations is CSS-based, triggered by a class on the `<html>` or `<body>` element (e.g., `.reduce-motion-enabled`). This class should override or nullify animation/transition properties.
    ```css
    /* Example */
    .reduce-motion-enabled * {
      animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
      animation-iteration-count: 1 !important; /* Stop repeating animations */
      transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
      scroll-behavior: auto !important;
    }
    ```
2.  **JavaScript Detection & Toggle:**
    * Implement JavaScript to detect the `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` media query and apply the `.reduce-motion-enabled` class by default if true.
    * If a site-specific toggle is part of the Accessibility Settings Panel, ensure it can override the OS setting and persist its state (e.g., via `localStorage`).
3.  **Comprehensive Application:** Systematically review EVERY animation and transition implemented across all components and global styles (entry animations, navigation, micro-interactions, graph/chart animations, content reveals, scroll effects). Confirm that the `.reduce-motion-enabled` class effectively stops or drastically simplifies them to essential, brief fades if some visual feedback for state change is still necessary.
4.  **Thorough Testing:** Test the entire site with 'Reduce Motion' enabled (both via OS simulation and site toggle if present) on desktop and mobile. Verify there is no distracting or uncomfortable residual motion.

<definition_of_done>
* `prefers-reduced-motion` media query is detected and respected by default.
* Site-specific 'Reduce Motion' toggle (if implemented) functions correctly and overrides OS preference.
* ALL non-essential animations and transitions site-wide are demonstrably disabled or reduced to minimal, essential feedback when 'Reduce Motion' is active.
* The user experience with 'Reduce Motion' active is clean, usable, and free of jarring motion.
</definition_of_done>
Why this is important: This ensures Sulayman's portfolio is inclusive and comfortable for users who are sensitive to motion or prefer a more static experience."

### Task 6.6 (Renumbered, was 6.4, Conditional): Implementing Interactivity for "Live Technical Analysis API" Module
<task id="6.6_ImplementLiveAPIInteractivityConditional">
  <objective>If the "Live Technical Analysis API" feature is approved (`P2_Live_API_Feature_Decision_And_Pattern.md`), to implement all its interactive functionalities, including user controls, real-time chart updates, and data feedback mechanisms, as per `Live_API_Feature_Integration_Patterns.md`.</objective>
  <prompt_to_developer>
    <instruction_for_claude>You (Claude 4) will say this to the Developer, ONLY if the Live API Feature was approved in Phase 2:</instruction_for_claude>
    <prompt_text>
"Developer, as we are implementing the 'Live Technical Analysis API' module using the [Insert Chosen Pattern from P2, e.g., Modal/Overlay with BlueprintJS `Dialog`], let's build its full interactivity:
1.  **API Connection & Initial Data Load (`APIConnectorService.js`):** Implement logic to fetch initial data from the specified API (from `Live_API_Source_And_Scope.md` in Phase 2). Display loading states using BlueprintJS `Spinner` with the 'shimmer' animation. Gracefully handle API errors or empty responses with styled BlueprintJS `Callout` messages.
2.  **Chart Rendering & Theming (`ChartDisplayComponent.js`):** Ensure the chart renders correctly with initial data, fully styled according to Palantir guidelines (colors, fonts, gridlines like #2C3A4A, axis labels #A0B0C0). Implement defined "Data Point Materialization" animations (e.g., lines drawing, bars growing).
3.  **Control Panel Functionality (`IndicatorControlsPanel.js`):**
    * Implement full functionality for all user controls: selecting assets/pairs, changing timeframes (e.g., via BlueprintJS `ButtonGroup`), adding/removing technical indicators, and configuring indicator parameters (e.g., via BlueprintJS `Select`, `MultiSelect`, `NumericInput`).
    * Ensure the chart and any displayed metrics update dynamically and performantly in response to control changes.
4.  **Real-Time Data Updates & Feedback:** Implement the chosen data update mechanism (polling or WebSockets). Visually indicate updates (e.g., "Data Pulse" effect on metrics, updated 'Last Updated' timestamp).
5.  **Interactive Chart Features:** Implement interactive tooltips (styled BlueprintJS `Popover`) displaying precise values on chart hover/tap. If planned, enable other chart interactions like zoom/pan with keyboard equivalents.
6.  **Accessibility:** Ensure all controls are keyboard accessible and have appropriate ARIA attributes. Chart data should be accessible as per `Advanced_Accessibility_Techniques.md`.

<definition_of_done>
* Live API module fetches, processes, and displays initial data correctly.
* All user controls are fully functional and dynamically update the chart and related data.
* Real-time data updates are implemented and clearly indicated.
* Interactive tooltips and other chart interactions work as specified.
* Loading states, error states, and empty states are handled gracefully.
* The module is performant and keyboard accessible.
* All animations respect 'Reduce Motion'.
</definition_of_done>
Why this is important: This optional feature is a direct showcase of Sulayman's technical abilities; its interactivity must be robust, intuitive, and align with the high standards of the rest of the portfolio."

## 5. Prompt-Engineering Best Practices for Claude 4 (Self-Audit)

<self_audit_checklist>
* **Agentic Proactivity & Parameter Precision:** Have I ensured that my prompts to the Developer provide extremely precise, parameter-driven descriptions for *every* animation and interaction? Are timings (e.g., 150ms, 300ms), easing functions (e.g., ease-out), target CSS properties, and specific visual outcomes (e.g., "1px downward shift," "shimmer gradient wipe") clearly defined for Claude 4 to generate correct code guidance?
* **Deep Research Integration (Motion, Accessibility, Mobile):** Is my guidance thoroughly cross-referencing and synthesizing requirements from `P2_Motion_Design_Detailed_Specs_V1.md`, `Advanced_Accessibility_Techniques.md` (especially regarding keyboard interaction with dynamic elements and motion sensitivity), and `Mobile_Adaptation_Palantir_Viz.md` (for touch targets and mobile-specific animation performance)?
* **Reinforcing "Purposeful Animation":** Am I consistently linking each animation back to its purpose (feedback, guidance, state change, enhancing clarity) to prevent purely decorative effects that would contradict the Palantir ethos?
* **Performance as a Design Constraint for Interactivity:** Am I prompting the Developer to consider performance implications (CPU usage, jank, layout thrashing) *during* the implementation of animations and interactions, not just as a later testing step? (Apply interim best practices if specific CSS performance research is pending).
* **"Reduce Motion" as a Universal Requirement:** Have I made it unequivocally clear that *all* non-essential animations must be disabled/minimized by the "Reduce Motion" feature? Is this a primary check in my review process?
* **Clarity of "Definition of Done" for Complex Interactions:** For multifaceted interactive features like the Network Graph or Live API module, does the Definition of Done comprehensively cover all aspects of their functionality, appearance, and behavior?
* **Consistency Check:** Am I ensuring that similar interactions (e.g., all modal openings, all hover states on primary buttons) use consistent animation timings and styles across the site?
